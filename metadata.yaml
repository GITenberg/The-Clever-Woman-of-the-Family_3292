description: '" ... Focuses on a group of women in a small seaside community [in England].
  It is the early 1860s, and British women outnumber men to such an extent that not
  all women can expect to marry. Rachel Curtis, the clever woman of the title, is
  an opinionated young woman whose yearning for a "mission" in life leads to tragicomic
  results."--Back cover.'
